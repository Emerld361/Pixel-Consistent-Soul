# Pixel-Consistent-Soul
The scariest DELTARUNE mod ever.
Makes the soul's sprites not have that weird sloping on the top making it look a lot nicer to the eyes
I've changed all soul colors to be in this style, and all the menu sprites. If i have missed any sprites or catastrophically fucked something up, please tell me and I will try and fix it
